"Column Name","Definition"
"Property Id","Unique property ID number"
"Property Name","Name of the property"
"Address 1","Street address of the property"
"Property GFA - Self-Reported (ft²)","The Gross Floor Area (GFA) is the total property square footage, measured between the principal exterior surfaces of the enclosing fixed walls of the building. This includes all areas inside the building including supporting areas. "
"Year Ending","Last date of energy data collection from the site, for that year"
"Site EUI (kBtu/ft²)","Energy Use Intensity of the site:  total energy consumed by the building in one year (measured in kBtu or GJ), divided by the total gross floor area of the building"
"Weather Normalized Site EUI (kBtu/ft²)","The amount of energy the building would have consumed in one year under 30-average weather conditions (also called climate normals), divided by the total gross floor area of the building. (This enables building performance comparison over time, despite unusual weather events)"
"Source EUI (kBtu/ft²)","Energy Use Intensity of the source: the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the building for one year (including all transmission, delivery, and production losses), divided by the total gross floor area of the building"
"Weather Normalized Source EUI (kBtu/ft²)","The amount of raw fuel that would have been required to operate the building for one year under 30-average weather conditions (also called climate normals), divided by the total gross floor area of the building. (This enables building performance comparison over time, despite unusual weather events)"
"Electricity Use - Grid Purchase (kBtu)","The total annual consumption of grid-purchased electricity in kBtu"
"Electricity Use - Grid Purchase (kWh)","The total annual consumption of grid-purchased electricity in kWh"
"Weather Normalized Site Electricity (kWh)","The amount of electricity the building would have consumed that year if weather had been climate normal"
"Natural Gas Use (kBtu)","The total annual consumption of natural gas in kBtu"
"Natural Gas Use (therms)","The total annual consumption of natural gas in therms"
"Weather Normalized Site Natural Gas Use (therms)","The amount of natural gas the building would have consumed that year if weather had been climate normal"
"District Steam Use (kBtu)","The total annual consumption of district steam in kBtu"
"Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)","The total annual greenhouse gas emissions due to building operations as calculated by Portfolio Manager (which accounts for the carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions from on-site fuel combustion and purchased electricity and district heating and cooling)"
"Total GHG Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/ft²)","The total annual greenhouse gas emissions due to building operations as calculated by Portfolio Manager, divided by the total gross floor area of the building"
"Energy Cost ($)","The total annual cost of energy for the building"
"Energy Cost Intensity ($/ft²)","The total annual cost of energy for the building, divided by the total gross floor area of the building"
